        <h2>The Subaru Impreza</h2>
        <p>The Impreza started out like any other sedan, wuth the replacement of the EJ engine over it's last engine. It was the base for the WRX.</p>

        <h2>The Start Of The WRX/STI - The Mean Eye GC8</h2>
        <p>As the impreza was made, the WRX was built on top of the base impreza and took the name for the name that would soon take the rally world. But on top on that was the STI verison which only a certain number were made at the a few years later. They were the better performance cars follwing on the success in the enginerring at Subaru Tecnica International, hence STI badges were placed on them. </p>

        <h3>The 22b STI</h3>
        <p>The 22b STI was produced in 1998 and to today was of the most rarest subaru's around. The last one that went up for sale most recently sold for over $300,000. The 22b was made after Subaru's 40th annivesity as a brand. The fact that they are so special to subaru's brand is the reason why they are so rare and high selling. With a widebody upgrade, engine upgrade, suspension upgrade, and almsot everything else that is 22b unqiue. </p>

        <h3>The Type RA</h3>
        <p>The Type RA - standing for Record Attempt from which they were trying to break the famous NÃ¼rburgring speed record. This was the first verision on the Type RA and it was with the gc8 platform, producing only a limtied amount and are rare and special but only pair in comparison to the 22b.</p>

        <h2>2000-2003 - The Bug Eye GD/GG</h2>
        <p>Subaru reinovated the impreza to a different body, wide than the previous. The first generation is what is known as the Bug Eye, from how the front headlights looked liked, in which they used the improved EJ205 engine to produce more power and relibaliity, which produced a sedan and wagon variant. This proved highly successful for Subaru and their rally carrer.</p>

        <h2>2003-2006 - The Blob Eye GD/GG</h2>
        <p>Following the production of the Bug Eye, subaru changed the body style of the WRX/STI to be a different with improved aerodyamincs and engine modificaions that propelled the fanbase to be larger as it was more of what they were seeing in the rally scene.</p>

        <h2>2006-2007 - The Hawk Eye GD/GG</h2>
        <p>The hawkeye, one of the most prized WRX/STI models being that it was only produced for the singular year. This was the final body and engine modifciation to this model in which Subaru placed more aggressive front end and the EJ25 in which had more power than the previous generations, along with some interior changes Which made it successful until they stopped production.</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>2008-2010 - The Stink Eye Narrow Body GH/GE</h2>
        <p>Subaru moved onto a new body style for the imprezas, and being so the WRX/STI also did too. The previous generations had wagons, however Subaru decided to replace it with a hatch variant, and this hatch was the only STI model while the WRXs came in both hatch and sedans. Using the EJ255 engines in the WRXs with 5 speed only and the EJ257 engines in the STIs with 6 speed only with an SI-Drive mode, along with different turbo and suspenion. This decision was made to make the two different and allow for the WRX to be more affordable. However there were notable problems in these models inclduing ringland failure, firewall failures, and weak 5 speeds that would fail. The narrow body is called being that it was flat and had a regular sedan look to the body, which most even to this day do not like. </p>

        <h2>2011-2014 - Stink Eye The Wide Body GR/GV</h2>
        <p>Due to the response, the widebody generation of the hatch and sedan were produced, with improved effiecency of the EJ heads, and the STI was also made as a sedan as well. This made it much more appealing to Subaru's fanbase and helped improve aerodyamincs and overall a better model. They were quite popular and is exactly what Subaru's rally carrer built success upon, esepcially with David Higgins and the rally title race.</p>

        <h2>2015-2021 - The Raptor Eye VA</h2>
        <p>The new model WRX/STI was produced in 2015-2021 with a rebranding of the car and model. Still based around the impreza's body, however Subaru finally changed the name to be their own model, as the WRX instead of impreza WRX. This model was the longest produced model with several changes. This time the WRX and STI were much different, the engine the WRX had was much different then the STI. This was conversial but overall was successful in the market. Although in the rally world they were using the STI EJs, the WRXs with the FA20-DIT were proved to be viable with the fanbase even without the iconic subaru rumble. </p>

        <h3>The Type RA - Revised</h3>
        <p>The Type RA had seen its revisions throughout the years, but this is the most notable as such only 500 were made with increased performance modificaions, carbon fiber roof and wing, better suspension and special cherry blossom accents. The engine block used proved to be well worth it as in the 2019+ STI models they switched to it for stronger pistons and more reliable power.</p>

        <h3>The S209</h3>
        <p>The S209, which is also very special limited to only 209 vehicles. There has been a long line of S models that have not been mentioned before but the S209 was the most powerful of them all and imroves body and engine performance and is the first S-model to be sold in the U.S which makes it even special compared to the other S-line models. The S-line is made to push the current generation to the max, and this is what the S209 does with the EJ.</p>

        <h2>The Present - 2022 WRX - The VB</h2>
        <p>The newest model of the WRX, that of which does not include the STI uses the newest engine FA24-DIT. Vareity of body and performance changes. At the moment there is not much of a liking from Subaru's fanbase around the current model, most critism has come based on the rear end, in which takes a plastic bumper that sticks and tailights similar to those you would see in the Honda Civic. The plastic fender flares as well recieved a lot of critism for degrading the overall look of the car. As they stopped the production of the STI, the EJ is no longer in production. The STI according to Subaru's statement will be produced as an electric verision. It is unclear if the STI will be fully electric or a hybrid based with the FA24. It is too early to tell what will happen to Subaru's fanbase and value as a company based on this deicison. Only time will tell with the newest generation.</p>
